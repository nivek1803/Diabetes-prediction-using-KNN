# Diabetes-prediction-using-KNN
This is a machine learning project based on the prediction of type 2 diabetes, with a given data. It uses K-nearest neighbors to classify the diabetic outcomes of each person's record.The diabetes is growing threat nowadays, one of the reasons being that there is no perfect cure for it.

Diabetes is commonly called diabetes mellitus. It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). We consider the mellitus here. After several researches we found that, some parameters are directly responsible for the mellitus to occur. By using the data of the people with diabetes and without diabetes, a dataset has been build. We use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes.
